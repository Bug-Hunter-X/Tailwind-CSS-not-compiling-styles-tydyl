# Tailwind CSS Not Compiling Styles

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS fails to compile or apply styles despite proper setup. The problem often stems from incorrect configuration or missing build steps.

## Problem

Even with seemingly correct Tailwind configuration, the styles are not applied to HTML elements. This could result in no visual changes or unexpected behaviour.

## Solution

The solution usually involves double-checking the `tailwind.config.js` file, ensuring the `content` array correctly points to your source files, verifying build process integration, and confirming that the Tailwind directives are correctly used in your HTML or JSX files.

Ensure you have followed the official Tailwind CSS installation and setup instructions for your framework or build system, which may involve additional steps beyond simply installing the package.
